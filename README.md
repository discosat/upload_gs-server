# DTP Server-side Uploading Node
This software is intended to serve as a server-side node for the <b>Ground Station</b>. The purpose of this node is to enable uploading to the client DTP on our satellite DISCO2; in practice, we will have a reverse server-client relationship between the Ground Station and DISCO2. 

For the client-side node to be used by the satellite, please check the [upload_sat-client. ](https://github.com/discosat/upload_sat-client)
