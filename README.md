# DTP Server-side Uploading Node
This software is to be used as a server-side node for the <b>Ground Station</b>. The purpose of this node is to be able to upload to the satellite DISCO2; in practice, we will have a reverse server-client relation between the Ground Station and DISCO2. 

For the client-side node to be used by the satellite, please check out upload_ground.
